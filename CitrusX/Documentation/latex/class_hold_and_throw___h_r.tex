\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Lets the player hold, drop and throw the object using the mouse. 

Update checks if the object is being held. If so it drops the object if the player gets too far from it (in the case of it being stuck) or if the player lets go of it Hold() sets the parent of the object to an empty Hold\+Guide object on the player and sets its local position to 0 and ensures that it is not affected by gravity and its velocity is 0. Drop stops the object from having a parent and lets gravity affect it again When the player uses the mouse on the object\textquotesingle{}s collider they can pick it up/drop it
