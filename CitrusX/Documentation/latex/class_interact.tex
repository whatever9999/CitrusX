\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Placed on the player, this class handles interactions using tags. 

This class is placed on the player so that they may interact with items according to their tag. It does this using raycasting. If the player is looking at an interactable object the class changes the material of that object so it has a glow shader. The class also contains a record of how many coins the player has collected from the water bowl and has a check to see if they have all of the coins (this can be used to see if the game is over).
