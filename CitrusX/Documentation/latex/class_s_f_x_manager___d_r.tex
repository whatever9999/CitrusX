\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Instantiates a prefab in the centre of the scene that plays a sound effect. 

This class is a don\textquotesingle{}t destroy singleton and should be added to a start scene that will persist throughout the game and can be accessed using S\+F\+X\+Manager\+\_\+\+D\+R.\+instance Sound effects are instantiated using an enum. This is linked to an audio clip passed in through the inspector. The class handles the destuction of the prefab. Play\+Effect(name) plays an effect for its length then destroys it Play\+Effect(name, seconds\+To\+Play) plays an effect on a loop and destroys it after seconds\+To\+Play
